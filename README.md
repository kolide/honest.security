## The Five Tenants of Honest Security
1. The values your organization stands behind **should be well-represented in
your security program**.

2. **A positive working relationship** between the end-user and the security team
is incredibly valuable and worth fostering.

3. This relationship is built on a foundation of trust that is demonstrated
through **informed consent and transparency**.

4. The security team should **anticipate and expect that end-users use their
company owned devices for personal activities** and design their detection
capabilities with this in mind.

5. End-users are capable of making rational and informed decisions **about
security risks** when educated and honestly motivated.
